Translation work for chapter one occurs in the file lang_ja_ch1.json (You should reference lang_en_ch1.json for the meanings of lines)
When translations for chapter two begin, lang_ja.json will have the chapter 1 data copied over for convienence.
Sadly due to how the game is programmed, the English version of lines from chapter 2 are much harder to find.
